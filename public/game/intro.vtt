00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
 

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:29.160
With the fortunate few being selected and gone, we're left&nbsp;
here on Earth with a ticking clock.

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:36.986
We have about a year before our&nbsp;
air becomes completely methanized.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.480
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:58.046
Natural disasters  such as earthquakes that occur without&nbsp;
warning  and can cause great destruction

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.440
Volcanic eruptions that&nbsp;
destroy everything in its path

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.220
And methane gas releases in spurts&nbsp;
have become a reoccurring event

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.820
But there could be a way out

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.040
CROB or The Center for&nbsp;
Research on Organic Biominerals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.200
is a closely guarded group of scientists&nbsp;
who discovered a biomineral: Movilennium

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.920
Movilennium is a volatile biomineral&nbsp;
that is found deep in the mines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:21.120
It is extremely valuable and rare. CROB&nbsp;
scientists claim that with enough Movilennium

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:31.020
they can conduct a genetic experiment&nbsp;on the human genome that can alter the DNA of a human being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:41.280
and turn him into what they call a 'Methanite'.&nbsp;
A being that's able to breathe methanized air

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
Which will become prevalent in&nbsp;
the atmosphere in about a year

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.860
The claim was found bona fide which&nbsp;
has caused the rise of competition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.820
over dominance of land containing&nbsp;
resources -especially Movilennium.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.400
In the search for Movilennium,&nbsp;
people have formed coalitions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.120
called tribes which allow them to work&nbsp;
together in order to become 'Methanites'.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.220
The world is in chaos as the tribes are&nbsp;
willing to kill in order to turn into reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.960
the newfound hope to evolve...
